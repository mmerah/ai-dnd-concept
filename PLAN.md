# Plan

The phased plan for what is built next, in order. Phase 1 (the small Director contract) and the
2026-08-17 drastic simplification (Cairn 2e deleted, the wire contract cut to `roll` + `effects`)
shipped and live in PROGRESS.md. Phase 2 is the scenario creator, Phase 3 media. Each phase
carries enough detail to implement without prior context; only the next unshipped phase needs
full resolution. Shipped phases move to PROGRESS.md.

## Working rules

1. **Golden fixtures are the behavior contract.** `AIDM_GOLDEN_REGEN=1` rewrites them; use it only
   in the same commit as the change that justifies the movement, and read the diff — an unexpected
   fixture moving is a bug, not churn. Any phase that changes persisted bytes bumps `SAVE_VERSION`
   (`src/aidm/state/base.py`) and regenerates the `save/state/turn` fixture families; stale saves
   are refused, never converted.
2. **Probe a new role's output mode live before trusting it.** gpt-oss-120b emitted zero plan
   effects under `NativeOutput` on the Director's large schema, while small schemas (worldkeeper,
   advisor, scene) are fine natively. Every new role — and every schema a phase reshapes — starts
   as `NativeOutput` on a small schema and gets one live probe before fixture work begins.
3. **Evals are manual and noisy.** Live eval gates stay suspended; golden fixtures and offline
   parity tests are the safety net. Only same-hour runs of the same tree are comparable, and
   nothing below n=9 per case is attributable to a change.

Per phase: `uv run pytest && uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check && uv run
basedpyright` green after every numbered step, one commit per step.

## Phase 1 — One small Director contract

Shipped in full; see PROGRESS.md. The live probe passed (2026-08-17): the shrunk contract runs
under `NativeOutput`, and the `ToolOutput`-era shims are deleted.

## Phase 2 — Scenario creator (~3–4 days)

Premise → a complete scenario in the exact on-disk format, authored by a strong model at
authoring time. This is a script, not the app: agentic workflows are fine outside the turn
loop, where speed and small-model reliability do not constrain the design.

1. `scripts/create_scenario.py <slug> "<premise>"`. A pydantic-ai agent whose output type **is**
   `ScenarioWorld` (`NativeOutput`) — the strictest spec of the shared format already exists and
   is the validator. Role config key `creator` (set a strong model in `.env`:
   `ROLES__CREATOR__MODEL=...`). Give it one read-only tool returning whispering-vault's
   `world.json` as the worked example, and put the authoring bar in the instructions: 4+
   locations connected by relations with at least one hidden and one `locked` way, 2+ NPCs with
   at least one unrevealed, one secret item, at least one thread with hooks that advance it on
   `entity_discovered` facts, hook `note`s that steer the Director, and `detail.hook` on every
   entity worth one.
2. Validation loop, in the script: `ScenarioWorld` validates structurally on output (the agent
   retries on `ValidationError` for free). Then validate the world alone — a `Scenario` per
   shipped engine with an empty/default overlay, `begin_game` with the shipped `kael`, and the
   engine's normal mechanics validation. Any `ValueError` goes back to the agent as a retry
   message, max 3 rounds, then fail loudly with the reason.
3. Overlays: a second agent call per shipped engine, output that engine's strict
   authored-overlay model, prompted with the generated world and engine-provided authoring
   guidance/defaults. Re-run step 2's loop with each generated overlay in place — the overlay
   is what `begin_game` exercises beyond shared structure.
4. Files land in `scenarios/<slug>/` only after every shipped engine validates. The script
   prints a summary (entities, relations, threads, hooks per engine) and the author reviews the
   diff before committing — generated content merges by the same review as hand-written
   content.

Done when: `uv run python scripts/create_scenario.py rats-of-thornhill "..."` yields a scenario
that appears on the home page and plays a first turn under every shipped engine. Quality beyond
validity is judged by playing it, not asserted by the script. PDF/notes ingestion is a later
input mode for the same script, not a separate system.

## Phase 3 — Media: scene illustrations (~2–3 days)

Presentation only, outside mechanical truth: the game must be indistinguishable with media
disabled, and a failed generation must cost nothing but a log line.

1. `MediaConfig` on `Settings`: `enabled: bool = False`, `provider: ProviderName = "openrouter"`,
   `model: str` (an image-capable model id). `src/aidm/app/media.py`:
   `illustration_request(state: GameState, narration: str) -> str` builds the image prompt
   deterministically — location name and brief, the `here` entities' briefs, the narration — **no
   model call decides whether to illustrate**; a Producer role is not built until a deterministic
   builder proves insufficient. `async generate(prompt, config) -> bytes | None` calls the image
   API and returns None on any failure (logged, never notified).
2. Wiring, at the boundary: after the commit in `GameSession.submit`, when media is enabled,
   schedule generation as a background asyncio task writing
   `saves/<slug>.media/turn-<n>.png`. The turn returns without waiting. `restart()` discards the
   media directory alongside the save.
3. UI: the chat panel shows the image above its exchange when the file exists; refresh on next
   submit (simplest) picks up late arrivals, a `ui.timer` only if that feels bad in practice. No
   gallery, no regeneration button.
4. Tests: the request builder is pure — one test on its output for a known state; the generate
   path is not tested live (network rule). Voice, portraits, and ambient audio are later phases
   of the same shape, none specced until wanted.

Done when: with media enabled a turn grows an illustration within seconds after the narration,
and with it disabled (the default) nothing in state, saves, prompts, or tests differs.
